This submission is to make sure that it passes certification.\n\nStart the skill, and it will present you with the name of an actor or actress.  You have to guess the show that the skill is thinking of.  If you get it wrong, you can continue guessing, or ask for a hint.\n\nUsers can buy 5 hints for $0.99.  Each question has two additional hints available, so after two hints, it should stop them from using additional hints, and force the user to get it correct or give up.",
